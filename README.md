# Starbound-bardez-mORE-liquids-FU-compatability

This repo is a mod for [Starbound](https://playstarbound.com/), based on top of the following mods:
- [Frackin' Universe](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729480149)
- [Frackin' Universe Research: Madness: Liquify Everything!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2901449779)
- [mORE Liquids](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1318339314)
- [mORE Liquids Fix Patch](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2128491231), albeit a loose basis

This mod does the following:

- [X] Fixes the still-remaining conflict between `Molten Coal` in mORE Liquids and `Refined Mech Fuel` when coal placed in the world (uses liquid ID `19`)
- [X] Converts `Molten Iron` from mORE Liquids into `Liquid Iron` from Frackin' Universe (because it has all of the interactions in FU)
- [X] Adds centrifugable recipes from mORE Liquids to FU advanced centrifuges
- [X] Adds in some somewhat more intelligent and variant language to the liquids, not just the "pulled this out too soon" text.
- [X] Adds research nodes to FU research tree for the molten items in the geology tree
  - Coal and Pixels are on the madness tree for being silly
- [X] Moves molten coal and molten pixel to fission furnace for recipe, tiered for being silly/crazy
- [X] Disables the uncrafting of liquids/bars via other mods (since this mod already does that and for FU consistency)
- [X] Renames the `Molten XYZ` liquids to `Liquid XYZ` for consistency with Frackin' Universe
- [X] Provides a patch to remove the blueprints added by [mORE Liquids Fix Patch](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2128491231)
