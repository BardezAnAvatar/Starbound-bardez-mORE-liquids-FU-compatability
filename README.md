# Starbound-bardez-mORE-liquids-FU-plus

This repo is a mod for [Starbound](https://playstarbound.com/), based on top of the following mods:
- [Frackin' Universe](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729480149) 
- [mORE Liquids](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1318339314)
- [mORE Liquids Fix Patch](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2128491231), albeit a loose basis

This mod does the following:

- Fixes the still-remaining conflict between `Molten Coal` in mORE Liquids and `Refined Mech Fuel` when coal placed in the world
- Converts `Molten Iron` from mORE Liquids into `Liquid Iron` from Frackin' Universe (because it has all of the interactions in FU)
- Adds centrifugable recipes from mORE Liquids to FU advanced centrifuges
- Adds all conversion recipes from liquids to solids from mORE Liquids to Atomic Furnace
- Adds in some somewhat more intelligent and variant language to the liquids, not just the "pulled this out too soon" text.
