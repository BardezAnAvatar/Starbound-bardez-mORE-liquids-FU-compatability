  "description" : "Provides the following fixes for compatability between [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729480149]Frackin' Universe[/url] (FU) and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1318339314]mORE Liquids[/url]:\n[list]\n  [*]Provides fix for liquid coal/mech fuel conflict with FU\n    [list]\n      [*]uses liquid ID `[b]19[/b]`\n      [*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2128491231]mORE Liquids Fix Patch[/url] has issues:\n        [list]\n          [*]Does not have Frackin' Universe as a dependency/include soft-prerequisite\n          [*]Its liquid ID path patch is erroneous and causes errors in the log\n        [/list]\n    [/list]\n  [*]Adds centrifugable recipes for the molten liquids\n    [list]\n      [*]Added a lulz-y 20-pixel voxel for centrifuging molten pixels\n    [/list]\n  [*]Replaces the molten iron recipes, and liquid/item conversions to instead generate FU's liquid iron (due to its extraction/centrifuge integrations already existing)\n  [*]Replaces the molten liquid inventory item descriptions from mORE Liquids to be somewhat more intelligent, scientific, and variant; not just the \"pulled this out too soon\" existing text.\n    [list]\n      [*]Added in yellow `centrifugable` 'tag' text that FU uses\n      [*]Took a lead from liquid iron in FU and added in some science-y facts\n      [*]Molten pixels is just silly, so kept its description silly albeit less inane\n    [/list]\n  [*]Added decompression recipes to atomic furnace. Re-balanced the liquid to bar ratio to be 10:1 rather than 1:3, which is more in line with FU's liquid iron. Plus it just feels more balanced.\n    [list]\n      [*]The existing pixel (de)compressor recipes are un-touched and still allow for lossless processing back and forth\n    [/list]\n  [*]Integrated with FU research tree to add molten liquids to the geology research tree as children of their base item type\n    [list]\n      [*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2128491231]mORE Liquids Fix Patch[/url] becomes a soft [b]incompatibility[/b], because I cannot reliably remove the molten liquids from player.config without knowing indexes, and that mod adds them at the end without specifying indexes; thus the molten items will always be known even if the items are not researched.\n    [/list]\n[/list]\n\n\n\nBoring Stuff:\n[url=https://github.com/BardezAnAvatar/Starbound-bardez-mORE-liquids-FU-compatability]Source on GitHub[/url]\n\n[b]Attributions[/b]:\n[list]\n  [*]Wrench icon appropriated from [url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Configure_openclipart.png]Wikimedia Commons[/url] by Etz Haim.
